# Introduction

## Notations

Throughout this tutorial, we adopt the following notation consistently. Let $D_i$ denote the treatment assignment status for unit $i$, where $d \in \{0, 1\}$ in the case of a binary treatment, though the framework can be extended to settings with multiple or continuous treatment levels. Let $Y_{di}$ represent the potential outcome for unit $i$ under treatment condition $d$. When the treatment is binary, the observed outcome for unit $i$ is given by the standard switching equation: $Y_i = D_i Y_{1i} + (1 - D_i) Y_{0i}$. 

We denote observed confounders using $X_i$ for a single variable, and $\textbf{X}_i$ for a row vector of multiple confounders for unit $i$. To indicate error-prone or proxy measures, we append an asterisk to the variable name. For example, $X_i^*$ denotes a noisy or proxy measure of $X_i$, and $D_i^*$ denotes a mismeasured/noisy/proxy version of the treatment variable $D_i$.

## Measurement Errors in DAGs and Potential Outcomes

### No Measurement Error

![](images/dag_no_error.svg){fig-align="center" width=40%}

- $X$ is an observed confounder
- Identification assumption: $Y_d \perp\!\!\!\perp D \mid X$

### Measurement Error in Treatment Variable

![](images/dag_error_in_treatment.svg){fig-align="center" width=40%}

- We cannot observe $D$ directly; instead, we observe $D^*$
- $D^*$ is a proxy or noisy measurement of $D$
- Even if $Y_d \perp\!\!\!\perp D \mid X$, identification via $D^*$ is not guaranteed: Does $Y_d \perp\!\!\!\perp D^* \mid X$ hold?

### Measurement Error in Observed Confounder

![](images/dag_error_in_confounder.svg){fig-align="center" width=40%}

- We cannot observe $X$ directly; instead, we observe $X^*$
- $X^*$ is a proxy or noisy measurement of $X$
- We know that $Y_d \perp\!\!\!\perp D \mid X$, but what about $Y_d \perp\!\!\!\perp D  \mid X^*$?


# What if we ignore measurement error?

## When error-prone variable is a treatment variable

## When error-prone variable is an observed confounder

# Parametric approach: Regression calibration

# Control variates approach
